# Intro

**This WIP uses svelte as GUI and golang and postgresql as backend.**

### Inspiration

Inspiration is taken from [algia](https://github.com/mattn/algia) and [gnost-relay](https://github.com/barkyq/gnost-relay).
And biggest thanks goes to fiatjaf [go-nostr](https://github.com/nbd-wtf/go-nostr) for making life easier.

## Goal

My goal is first of all to learn *go* better and to make a kind of twitter/X clone where you can use to read notes in peace, without getting distracted with the stream and flow of data. Maybe later i will add more features like zap and such. ***It is not my goal to make it mobile or running everywhere. It will always be a desktop app running locally, so you stay in control.***

## Requirements

You need [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) version 9.1 to build the source. 

## Installation and build

### Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/amavis442/nostr-reader-frontend.git 
```
This needs [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed or get the zip from github.

### Build
```
cd nostr-reader-frontend

npm install

npm run build  // will build the front-end
```

This will get the packages and build the frontend. The front-end will be stored in the *dist* folder. 

## Configuration

### Frontend

```
#.env.local
VITE_API_LINK=http://localhost:8080 // change this port to the same port as in config.json under server : {port: 8080}
VITE_APP_TRANSLATE_URL=http://translate.local/translate // leave this empty if you do not want to use libretranslate service
VITE_APP_MODE=dev  // set to prod for production
VITE_APP_TRANSLATE_LANG=nl // set to eng for English
```

If you want to change the server port (8080) into something else because of a conflict, then you need to rebuild the front-end. Set the port in *.env.local* with *VITE_API_LINK* and run ```npm run build```

## Execute 

Start nostr-reader.exe, make sure you have a valid config.json with at least your private key.
Also start the postgresql server on the standard port or change that in the config file. 

In browser goto http://localhost:8080/. If you want to set another port then change that in config.json and in .env.local and rebuild the server and the frontend.

The server takes a get data from the relays every 5 minutes. This is to make sure the relays are not getting stressed and you can read the notes in peace without flashing streams.
